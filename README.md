# Transforming button game ðŸ§¡ ðŸ’œ ðŸ’™

### This is a game that, while not being particularly engaging, now [EXISTS](https://alexmayberry.github.io/box-game/)!


## Instructions
Press the buttons to transform the box in these different ways!

## Roadmap
The effects of the buttons are currently hard coded. 
- In the future, I would like to use variables and more advanced functions to make the effects of the buttons incremental and add a second set of buttons that increment in the opposite way.
- In a later version, I'd like to add sliders to control the different properties.
- In a yet later version, I'd like to add fields where users can type values to control the properties as well.
